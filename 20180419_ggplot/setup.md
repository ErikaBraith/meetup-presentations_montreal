### Setup instructions

**Please complete steps 1 through 3 before the workshop!**

1. Please download R and RStudio before the lecture: 
  - [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
  - [RStudio desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop)

2. Please install the packages dplyr, ggplot2 and plotly:
  - Open RStudio. Click the "Packages" tab in the lower right window. Click "Install" and type in dplyr in the packages text box and click "Install". Repeat this step for the other two packages.
  - After you do this type "library(dplyr)" into the console (bottom left). Messages should appear, but warnings/failure message should not. Also load ggplot2 and plotly using the library() command.

3. Place the .Rproj file, lecture file, and sample datasets in a new folder (anywhere you’d like).

4. If RStudio is open, close it. Launch RStudio by opening the .Rproj file. On Mac, you’ll see that the RStudio window has listed the project’s directory at the top. Look in the File Viewer panel and see the files you downloaded. Type getwd() in the code console. Notice the pathway points to your folder.

5. Open the Lecture file in RStudio by selecting it from the file list.

6. During the workshop, we will follow the instructions in the R script to learn how to use dplyr, ggplot2, and plotly. A copy of the solutions will be added to this folder after the workshop.
